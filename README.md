# STM32 UART Communication

This repository contains detailed, fully documented examples for UART communication on the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller using register-level programming.

## ðŸ“„ Available UART Examples

| UART | Description         | Link                      |
|-------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| UART1 (Send) | Send character via UART1 (Tx) | [UART1_Send.md](./UART-Communication/UART1_Receive.md) |
| UART1 (Receive) | Receive character via UART1 (Rx) | [UART1_Receive.md](./UART-Communication/UART1_Receive.md) |
| UART3 (Send) | Send character via UART3 (Tx) | [UART3_Send.md](./UART-Communication/UART3_Send.md) |
| UART3 (Receive) | Receive character via UART3 (Rx) | [UART3_Receive.md](./UART-Communication/UART3_Receive.md) |


## Each example includes:
